/**
 * Effect-TS scoped service wrapping a `modbus-rs` RTU serial transport.
 *
 * Opens a serial port in RTU (Remote Terminal Unit) mode via
 * {@link AsyncRtuTransport.open} and manages a scoped lifecycle — the
 * transport is automatically closed when the consuming `Scope` finalizes.
 *
 * Device clients are cached per {@link CreateClientOptions.unitId | unitId}
 * so that repeated calls to `withClient` for the same unit share the
 * underlying `AsyncSerialModbusClient`. Each returned client is a
 * lightweight {@link EffectModbusClient} that converts Promise-based
 * upstream calls into `Effect.Effect` with typed error handling.
 *
 * ### Usage
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { RtuTransportService } from "./RtuTransportService.js";
 * import { Layer } from "effect";
 *
 * const layer = RtuTransportService.default({ portPath: "/dev/ttyUSB0", baudRate: 19200 });
 * ```
 *
 * @see AsyncRtuTransport — Upstream `modbus-rs` RTU transport class.
 * @see RtuTransportOptions — Connection options for the serial RTU port.
 * @see AsyncSerialModbusClient — Client type created by the RTU transport.
